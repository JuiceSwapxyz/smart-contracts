# ========================================
# Governance Deployment Options
# ========================================

# Transfer ownership of Factory and ProxyAdmin to Governor after deployment
# Set to "true" to transfer ownership (decentralization)
# Set to "false" to deploy contracts only without transferring ownership (default)
# You can always transfer ownership later manually
TRANSFER_OWNERSHIP=false

# ========================================
# NOTE: Contract addresses from npm packages
# ========================================
# NO contract addresses are needed in .env!
# All addresses are imported from their canonical npm packages:
#
# From @juicedollar/jusd:
#   - JUSD_ADDRESS (ADDRESS[chainId].juiceDollar)
#   - SV_JUSD_ADDRESS (ADDRESS[chainId].savingsVaultJUSD)
#   - JUICE_ADDRESS (ADDRESS[chainId].equity)
#
# From @juiceswapxyz/sdk-core:
#   - WCBTC_ADDRESS (WETH9[chainId].address)
#   - SWAP_ROUTER_ADDRESS (CHAIN_TO_ADDRESSES_MAP[chainId].swapRouter02Address)
#   - POSITION_MANAGER_ADDRESS (CHAIN_TO_ADDRESSES_MAP[chainId].nonfungiblePositionManagerAddress)
#   - FACTORY_ADDRESS (V3_CORE_FACTORY_ADDRESSES[chainId])
#   - PROXY_ADMIN_ADDRESS (CHAIN_TO_ADDRESSES_MAP[chainId].proxyAdminAddress)
#
# This ensures single source of truth and eliminates sync issues!
