# Governance-Specific Configuration
# ========================================
# Only addresses that are NOT in npm packages need to be in .env

# ProxyAdmin address (governance-specific, deployed separately)
PROXY_ADMIN_ADDRESS=0x4e20Ec7daaaeA8B135bf825556Bd70C062D0ee09

# ========================================
# NOTE: Addresses from npm packages
# ========================================
# The following addresses are NO LONGER needed in .env!
# They are imported from their canonical npm packages:
#
# From @juicedollar/jusd:
#   - JUSD_ADDRESS (ADDRESS[chainId].juiceDollar)
#   - SV_JUSD_ADDRESS (ADDRESS[chainId].savingsVaultJUSD)
#   - JUICE_ADDRESS (ADDRESS[chainId].equity)
#
# From @juiceswapxyz/sdk-core:
#   - WCBTC_ADDRESS (WETH9[chainId].address)
#   - SWAP_ROUTER_ADDRESS (CHAIN_TO_ADDRESSES_MAP[chainId].swapRouter02Address)
#   - POSITION_MANAGER_ADDRESS (CHAIN_TO_ADDRESSES_MAP[chainId].nonfungiblePositionManagerAddress)
#   - FACTORY_ADDRESS (V3_CORE_FACTORY_ADDRESSES[chainId])
#
# This ensures single source of truth and eliminates sync issues!
